# ðŸ’£ Minesweeper React

A modern, responsive Minesweeper game built with React and TypeScript. Features three difficulty levels, timer, mine counter, and a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy (9Ã—9, 10 mines), Medium (16Ã—16, 40 mines), Hard (16Ã—30, 99 mines)
- **Game Timer**: Tracks elapsed time during gameplay
- **Mine Counter**: Shows remaining mines (total mines minus flagged cells)
- **Flag System**: Right-click to flag suspected mines
- **Auto-reveal**: Empty cells automatically reveal adjacent cells
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean design with smooth animations and hover effects

## How to Play

1. **Left-click** on a cell to reveal it
2. **Right-click** on a cell to flag/unflag it
3. Numbers show how many mines are adjacent to that cell
4. Flag all mines and reveal all safe cells to win
5. Click on a mine to lose the game
6. Use the smiley button to start a new game

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Styling with flexbox and grid
- **ESLint** - Code linting

## Game Logic

The game implements classic Minesweeper rules:

- First click is always safe (mines are placed after the first click)
- Empty cells (0 adjacent mines) automatically reveal neighboring cells
- Win condition: All non-mine cells revealed
- Lose condition: Mine cell clicked
- Flagging system helps track suspected mines
